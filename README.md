你好：很高兴这个项目能够出现在你眼前！
XuanLaboratory – Toolbox是一个在Windows系统中，
同时具有用户模式和内核模式的Anti-RootKit工具。
本工具由5875616E本人独立开发，但也离不开网络上各路
大佬们提供的支持，在此一并感谢！

从2024年3月开始进行开发开始，已经过去了约一年了，由于住校生的原因，开发工作只能在周末零零散散地进行，不管如何，你的下载和使用是对我最大的支持，也是对我努力成果的肯定。谢谢！
值得注意的是，该项目仍未完成！你可以查看源代码，对这个项目提出建议或找出Bug，很高兴能收到你的建议！

考虑到Windows10、Windows11为当前的主流系统。Windows7及更早的系统使用人数较少，故没有进行相关的开发工作，但以后会进行相关的开发工作。


Hello: I'm glad that this project is in front of you!
XuanLaboratory – Toolbox is an Anti-RootKit tool that has both user mode and kernel mode on Windows systems.
This tool is developed by 5875616E, but it is also inseparable from the support provided by various bigwigs on the Internet, thank you here!

It's been about a year since the start of development in March 2024, and due to the boarding students, the development work can only be carried out sporadically on weekends, no matter what, your download and use is the greatest support for me and an affirmation of the results of my efforts. Thank you!
It is worth noting that the project is still not finished! You can view the source code, make suggestions for this project or find bugs, and I'd love to hear from you!

Considering that Windows 10 and Windows 11 are the current mainstream systems. Windows 7 and earlier systems have a small number of users, so there is no related development work, but related development work will be carried out in the future.
